Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    I think encapsulation can be a great way to organize code. It defitnitly makes you have to think more about 
    how things should be called. I think that the main benefit of encapsulation is security. Certain parts of code can be 
    protected with only trusted sources being given access, which could be very useful in a company setting.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What I struggled with the most this time was capitalization and little inconsistencies within naming
    variables and objects that caused me to have to go back and figure out the bug. I am also a little 
    confused with the function of this program. It is supposed to be something that can be used when needed? 
    I wasn't sure if we were meant to put in code to test if the program runs. In the rubric, one of the points 
    list, "Executes fully & consistently without crashing (exception/freeze)" which is what led me to be confused
    as I didnt undertsand if this was asking us to test the code. My advice to someone in the future would be
    to not be afriad to ask clarity questions for what the assignment is asking before it is due.

caused the code to not function.
